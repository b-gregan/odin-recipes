    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large
            baking sheet with parchment paper
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large mixingbowl, combine oats, nuts and or seeds, salt
            and cinnamon.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour in oil, maple syrup and vanilla. 
            Mix well until every oat and nut is lightly coated.
            <br>Pour the granola onto your prepared pan and use a large 
            spoon to spread it in an even layer.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake until lightly golden, about 21 to 24 minutes, 
           stirring halfway. The granola will further crisp as it cools.

        <br>
        <li>Let the granola cool completely undisturbed (45+ minutes)
            Top with the dried fruit or chocolate chips (optional)
            <br>Break the granola into pieces with your hands if you want to
            retain big chunks or stir with a spoon otherwise.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Store the granola in an airtight container at room
            temperature for 1 to 2 weeks, or in a sealed freezer bag 
            in the freezer up to 3 months.
        </li>
